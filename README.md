# dwolla-ofg
A quickstart tutorial application written in Rails 4 + bootstrap to illustrate the recommended off-site gateway UX flow.

Syntax highlighting done via [redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) and [rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge).

## Requirements
- Rails 4+
- Bundler

This application does not require any database access as all the data is processed via the Dwolla API. ActiveRecord has been removed from this project. 

## Getting Started

### The easy way

The default application key and secret bundled with the application are for you to use with the UAT environment, so they do not need to be changed. However, you do need to properly set `thing_price`, `shipping`, `destinationId`, and `redirect` in order for the off-site gateway checkout to be successful.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mach-kernel/dwolla-ofg.git
cd dwolla-ofg
bundle install && rails s
```

Afterwards, just visit your default Rails URL, which is probably `localhost:3000`.

### Hurt me plenty

Just kidding. The only thing that you would really need to configure are the `dwolla-ruby` variables. You can find everything that you need in `config/initializers/dwollavars.rb`

```ruby
require 'dwolla'

module DwollaVars
    mattr_reader  :Dwolla, :pin, :thing_price, :shipping, :destinationId, :redirect

    @@Dwolla ||= Dwolla
    
    @@Dwolla::api_key ||= nil
    @@Dwolla::api_secret ||= nil

    @@Dwolla::sandbox ||= true

    # This is due to laziness. Please use a shopping cart
    # plugin in production. This is just illustrative. I swear.
    @@thing_price = nil
    @@shipping = nil
    @@destinationId = nil
    @@redirect = "http://somehostna.me/dashboard/complete_checkout"
end
```

**Note**: These values cannot be edited on-the-fly (except from within a `rails c` session) and require a restart of the rails server. 

## Deploy to Heroku

Heroku is in the name of the repo, right?

### Requirements

- A [Heroku](https://heroku.com) account with an available instance.
- The [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed to your local machine (and added to your `%PATH%` variable if you are a Windows user).
- I recommend forking this repository so that you can have write privileges. 

### How-to deploy: the easy-peasy way

*Please* fork this repository before doing this.

1. Connect your GitHub account in your Heroku admin panel

2. Search for your repository

3. Deploy a branch

### How-to deploy: the devops special

1. Log in
    ```bash
    heroku login
    
    Enter your Heroku credentials.
    Email: you@example.com
    Password:
    Could not find an existing public key.
    Would you like to generate one? [Yn]
    Generating new SSH public key.
    Uploading ssh public key /Users/david/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

2. Install Rails
    ```bash
    gem install rails
    ```

3. Add Heroku gem, change `redirect`

    I would have done this for you, but this is more fun!
    
    ```bash
    echo "gem 'rails_12factor'" >> Gemfile
    bundle install
    ```

4. Drop back to your local machine's shell and change to the application directory

    This will add a heroku branch to the git repository
    
    ```bash
    heroku create
    Creating dwolla-rails-heroku... done, stack is cedar-14
    https://dwolla-rails-heroku.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/dwolla-rails-heroku.git
    Git remote heroku added
    ```

And finally, deploy and run.

```bash
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

That wasn't so bad, was it?
